# renderless-datepicker-script

Datepicker functionality without the UI. Unopinionated about style, it provides minimal interface for creating flexibile, and customizable datepicker funcionality for authors to stylize their datepicker as they wish. 

Why? Because every datepicker out there ships with their default styles or templates which can somethimes be a real hassle to customize, and often you need to fork it yourself or hack css with dozens of ``!important`` css statements. 

So the rendering is up to you.
